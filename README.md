These are some of my configuration files. If you can improve something, by all means open a pull request.

## .bashrc

Noteworthy portions of the functionality I share between bash and zsh.  I generally have it saved as `/etc/sh` and have it sourced by a line in my `bashrc` and `zshrc`:

```
. /etc/sh
```

## .vimrc

Vim is my primary editor (previously, Sublime and many others).  Every line in my .vimrc is intentional.
