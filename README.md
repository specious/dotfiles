Pieces to share from the configuration files I use.

Some of my configuration files are also posted here: https://keybase.pub/tknomad/files/config/

## .bashrc

Functionality I share between bash and zsh. I generally have it available as `/etc/sh` which is sourced by both my `.bashrc` and `.zshrc` files with the line:

```sh
. /etc/sh
```
My custom prompt with git integration is available for:
- [bash](https://gist.github.com/specious/8244801)
- [zsh](https://github.com/specious/bender)

Some parts may be specific to the Linux system I use.

## .vimrc

Vim is currently my favorite editor. Every line in my .vimrc is intentional.

## Also I use...
