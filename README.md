These are useful excerpts form some of my configuration files. If you can improve something, by all means open a pull request.

I'm sharing my entire configuration files as I use them in my keybase public folder: https://keybase.pub/tknomad/files/config/

## .bashrc

Noteworthy functionality I share between bash and zsh. I generally have it located at `/etc/sh` and sourced in my `bashrc` and `zshrc` with:

```
. /etc/sh
```

My fancy bash prompt with git integration is available for [bash](https://gist.github.com/specious/8244801) and [zsh](https://github.com/specious/bender).

## .vimrc

Vim is currently my primary editor. Every line in my .vimrc is intentional.
