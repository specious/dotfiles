Pieces to share from the configuration files I use.

My entire configuration files as I use them are here: https://keybase.pub/tknomad/files/config/

## .bashrc

Functionality I share between bash and zsh. I generally have it available as `/etc/sh` which is sourced by both my `.bashrc` and `.zshrc` files with the line:

```sh
. /etc/sh
```

My custom prompt with git integration is available for:
- [bash](https://gist.github.com/specious/8244801)
- [zsh](https://github.com/specious/bender)

## .vimrc

Vim is currently my favorite editor. Every line in my .vimrc is intentional.

## Also I use...

Firefox add-ons:
- [Markdown Viewer](https://github.com/simov/markdown-viewer)
- [QR Code](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/qr-code-address-bar/)
- [Pentadactyl](http://bug.5digits.org/pentadactyl/) (used to work with Firefox but is now availabe as a [Palemoon add-on](https://addons.palemoon.org/addon/pentadactyl-community/))
